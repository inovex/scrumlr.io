Scrumlr can be deployed using a Docker Compose file. This is the easiest way to get started with Scrumlr.
We maintain a Docker Compose file in our Repository that you can use to deploy Scrumlr.

## Prerequisites

Clone the Scrumlr repository to your server and navigate to the deployment directory.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/inovex/scrumlr.io
cd scrumlr.io/deployment/docker
```

After you cloned the repository and switched to the directory, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and adjust the
variables in the `.env` file to your needs.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

A description of all environment variables can be found [here](/self-hosting/env-vars/).
For a new deployment the mandatory variables to fill out are `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `SCRUMLR_PRIVATE_KEY`.

Some environment variables have a default value set in the Dockerfile.
If the variable is set in the `.env` file, the default value will be overwritten.
If an environment variable has no default value and is not set in the `.env` file, the value will be ignored.

## Generating needed secrets

### Postgres Password

Make sure to set the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` variable in your `.env` file to a secure password. For example you can generate
a 64 characters long one from the terminal with the following command (if you have `pwgen` installed):

```sh
pwgen -s 64 1
```

### JWT Private Key

We use an ECDSA private key to sign the JWT tokens.

***Make sure to keep this key secure as it can be used to decrypt the tokens and generate new ones, potentially
compromising your users' accounts.***

```sh
openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp521r1 -noout -out jwt.key
```

Now we need to encode this key to be able to use it as a string in the `.env` file:

```sh
cat jwt.key | awk '{printf "%s\\n", $0}'
```

Copy the result of this command and paste it into your `.env` file (with `\n` line breaks included) like this,
surrounded with quotes:

```ini
SCRUMLR_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

### Session Secret

Make sure to set the `SESSION_SECRET` variable in your `.env` file if you are using an authentication provider.
You can generate a session secret with

```sh
pwgen -s 64 1
```

## Deployment

You can now start the deployment using the following command.

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

After a few seconds you can check with `docker ps --all` to see if all the containers have started up.
The docker containers start in the following order

1. Postgres, nats and caddy
2. Scrumlr backend
3. Scrumlr frontend

If one crashed or if there is an issue you can check logs with `docker logs (container name or id)`

Once all container started you can vist `localhost:80` to access Scrumlr.

## Reverse Proxy

We strongly recommend using a reverse proxy to handle TLS termination and to provide a secure connection to your users.
Scrumlr should work with all major reverse proxies like [Nginx](https://nginx.org), [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/)
or [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/reverse-proxy).
We automatically include a caddy deployment in the docker-compose file, which you can use as a reverse proxy.
All you need to do is updating the `Caddyfile` to include your host domain instead of `:80`.
If you don't want TLS you can simply keep the specified port.
Keep in mind that running Scrumlr without TLS is **not recommended**.

```conf
your_domain {
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Scrumlr works fine on my machine, but others get an error when they click on "Start now"

Make sure the `SCRUMLR_SERVER_URL` in the `.env` file uses your external ip address, instead of `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.
You can search "what is my ip" on the internet to find your external ip address.
