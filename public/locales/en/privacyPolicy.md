We may receive information about you from third party providers of business information and publicly
available sources (like social media platforms), including physical mail addresses, email addresses,
intent data (or user behavior data), IP addresses and social media profiles,
for the purposes of account creation.

## How we use information we collect

Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect about you.

### To provide the Services and personalize your experience

We use information about you to provide the service to you, including to process transactions with you,
authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, and operate, maintain, and improve the Services.

### For research and development

We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated, and useful.
We use information about how people use our service to troubleshoot, to identify trends, usage, activity patterns,
and areas for integration and to improve our service and to develop new products, features and technologies that
benefit our users and the public.
For example we collect information how often board templates are selected in order to improve the selection
of templates.

### Customer support

We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance,
to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the service.

### For safety and security

We use information about you to verify accounts and activity, to detect, prevent,
and respond to potential or actual security incidents and to monitor and protect against other malicious,
deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity, including violations of Service policies.

### With your consent

We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above.
For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the service, with your
permission.

### Legal bases for processing (for EEA users)

If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where
we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal bases depend on the Services you use and
how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:

* We need it to provide you the service, including to operate the service, provide customer support and personalized
  features and to protect the safety and security of the service;
* It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research
  and development, to market and promote the service and to protect our legal rights and interests;
* You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or
* We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.

If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to
change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.

## How we store and secure information we collect

### Information storage and security

We use industry standard technical and organizational measures to secure the information we store. We host
the service in germany in a data center located in Frankfurt.

While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and
due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through
the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by
others.

### How long we keep information

How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further
detail below. After such time, we will either delete or de-identify your information or, if this is not
possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely
store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.

#### Account information

We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter
in case you decide to re-activate the service.  We also retain some of your information as necessary to
comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business
operations, and to continue to develop and improve our service. Where we retain information for service
improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we
only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically
analyze personal characteristics about you.

#### Information you share on the Services

If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will
remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the service. For example, we
continue to display messages you sent to the users that received them and continue to display content you
provided, but when requested details that can identify you will be removed.
