Applicability of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) shall be precluded.\n\nIn the event that the User should be (i) a registered businessman within the meaning of the “Handelsgesetzbuch” / German Commercial Code, (ii) a legal entity under public law or a special fund under public law, or (iii) if the User maintains no general venue of jurisdiction within the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany, Karlsruhe, Germany is agreed as venue of jurisdiction.
