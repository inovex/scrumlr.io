# Cookie policy of scrumlr.io

This document informs Users about the technologies that help scrumlr.io to achieve the purposes described below.
Such technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources
(for example by running a script) on a User’s device as they interact with scrumlr.io.

For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as &quot;Trackers&quot; within this document – unless there is a
reason to differentiate. For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate
to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this
reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular
type of Tracker.

Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User&apos;s consent. Whenever consent is given,
it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.

Scrumlr.io only uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called &quot;first-party&quot; Trackers). The validity
and expiration periods of first-party Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by the
Owner. Some of them expire upon termination of the User’s browsing session.

## Activities strictly necessary for the operation of scrumlr.io and delivery of the Service

Scrumlr.io uses so-called “technical” Cookies and other similar Trackers to carry out activities that are strictly
necessary for the operation or delivery of the Service.

## How to manage preferences and provide or withdraw consent

There are various ways to manage Tracker related preferences and to provide and withdraw consent, where relevant:
Users can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly within their own device settings, for example, by
preventing the use or storage of Trackers. Additionally, whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent, Users can
provide or withdraw such consent by setting their preferences within the cookie notice or by updating such preferences
accordingly via the relevant consent-preferences widget, if available.

It is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to delete previously stored Trackers, including those
used to remember the User’s initial consent. Other Trackers in the browser’s local memory may be cleared by deleting
the browsing history.

## Locating Tracker Settings

Users can, for example, find information about how to manage Cookies in the most commonly used browsers at the following
addresses:

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Apple Safari
- Microsoft Internet Explorer
- Microsoft Edge
- Brave
- Opera

Users may also manage certain categories of Trackers used on mobile apps by opting out through relevant device settings,
such as the device advertising settings for mobile devices, or tracking settings in general (Users may open the device
settings, view and look for the relevant setting).
