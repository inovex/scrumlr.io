# scrumlr.io Server

This is the server application of [scrumlr.io](https://scrumlr.io) targeted by the web client.

## Local development

To run the scrumlr backend locally for development, you first need to run the needed services (postgres database and nats).
For that you can use the provided docker compose files.
To start the docker containers either run

```bash
make run-docker-dev
```

or

```bash
docker compose --profile dev up
```

After the container started you can start the scrumlr backend with.

```bash
cd src/
go run . --database "postgres://admin:supersecret@localhost:5432/scrumlr?sslmode=disable" --disable-check-origin --insecure
```
