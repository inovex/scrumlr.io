## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>How can I add the support for another language?</summary>

  Just copy the base configuration `public/locales/en/translation.json` into a new
  directory with your language code `public/locales/{language code}/translation.json`
  and translate all values of the JSON properly. Once you're done you can open a pull
  request and we will try to review your translation by a few samples.
